# Project Euler problems
 My solutions to the problems in Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/about), coded in Python

In most cases, the solution files will start with answers I developed while learning the concepts needed to arrive at a solution. In some cases, after I have found a working solution, I may research other solutions and include them in the solution file with citations in the comments. Typically, if I lead with someone else's solution, i will annotate their code to provide explanations, in an effort to help learners such as myself.

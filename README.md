# Project Euler problems
 My solutions to the problems in Project Euler (projectuler.net), coded in Python

In all cases, the solution files will start with answers I developed while learning the concepts needed to arrive at a solution. In some cases, after I have found a working solution, I may research other solutions and include them in the solution file with citations in the comments.
